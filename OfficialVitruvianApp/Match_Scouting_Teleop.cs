					These lines are repeated a lot, they update the current score. SInce I made it in a hurry, it was copy/pasted, but ideally, it should be in a separate function, like SaveData().
					Doing this would mean that you need to move your other variables outside of the main class function.
					Note: So for the this function, I treat the coopertition stack/set separately (the stack doesnt depend on a set button press).
							I don't recall why I did this initially, but it makes sense scouting in the game, as a robot will usually complete one or another (a stack usually doesn't fall down after it is completed).
							Either way, the buttons for a set/stack were changed to be a toggle, instead of an addition, which allows the user to self-correct.
